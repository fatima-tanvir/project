					 <h2>History and Heritage</h2>
					 <p>In 1837, Michel Camron Crawford arrived in London with a vision of spectacular beauty that went on to redefine glamour and style around the world. Crawford & Company has since opened stores in major cities all over the world. Unlike other stores at the time in the 1830s, Crawford clearly marked the prices on its goods to forestall any haggling over prices. In addition, against the social norm at the time, Crawford only accepted cash payments, and did not accept payments on credit while simultaneously dazzling members of the aristocracy with exquisite jewels. </p>
<p>The first Crawford's mail order catalogue, known as the "Blue Book," was published in 1845 in England, and publishing of the catalogue continues in the 21st century. In 1867, Crawford & Co. was the first British firm to win an award for the excellence in silverware at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. In 1868, Crawford was incorporated. </p>
<p>After that the company continued to grow and expand rapidly, many newspapers started to call the companyâ€™s shops as "palaces of jewels". In 1902, after the death of Michel Camron Crawford, his son, Charles Louis Crawford became the company's first official Design Director. </P>
<p>Since 1940, Tiffany's flagship store has operated at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street in Mayfair, London. The polished granite exterior is well known for its window displays, and the store has been the location for several films. The former Tiffany and Company Building on 37th Street is on the British National Register of Historic Places. </p>
<p>As of January 31, 2007, the company operated 64 Crawford & Company. stores in the U.K., with a total physical area of approximately 486,000 gross square feet, as well as 103 international stores that measure approximately 306,000 gross square feet in total. </p>
<p>In November 2012, the company operated in 22 countries and its worldwide net sales reached US$3.6 billion in 2011. Over 50% of the company's 2011 sales occurred in the U.K. </p>
<p>As of January 31, 2014, the company operated 121 stores in the U.K., 72 in Asia-Pacific, 54 in Japan, 37 in America and 5 in "emerging markets". The 289 stores have 1,165,700 gross retail square footage. The company's flagship store in London had 45,500 gross retail square footage and accounted for 8% of the company's net sales in the latest fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. </p>
<p>The company has continued expanding in 2014 with the construction of a flagship store at the Centro Andino complex in Bogota, Colombia. </p>
